# NPM-Package-Explorer
This tool retrieves NPM Package Details directly from the NPM API. Users can enter an npm package name and view a list of packages associated with that name. The list includes the npm link and description for each package. Users can then select the package based on package description provided and go to the npm link to complete the installation.
